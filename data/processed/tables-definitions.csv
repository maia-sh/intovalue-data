registry-crossreg,"Generated by 'combine-ctgov-drks-trials.R'. Captures cross-registrations (`crossreg_trn` column) mentioned in registration in `id` column. `id` column includes trns found in 'trials' table `id` column, as well as additional trns found in metadata, abstract, or full-text of an associated publication. These additional `id`s are not included as `id`s but do appear as `crossreg_trn` in 'cross-registrations' table.",data/processed/registries/registry-crossreg
cross-registrations,"Generated by 'prepare-cross-registrations.R'. Captures cross-registrations (`crossreg_trn` column) associated with `id` in 'trials' table `id` column, as well as the source(s) of the cross-registration. The `id` column is limited to `id`s in 'trials' table `id` column; some `id`s in 'registry-crossreg' are therefore missing from the `id` column but are included in the `crossreg_trn` column.",data/processed/trn/cross-registrations
